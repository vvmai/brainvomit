            I knew something was up when I picked him up and he was much bigger than he had appeared in the pictures.
            When I took him to the vet that same day, he was already 11.4 lbs at 14 weeks old and underweight.
            For the next 9 months, I would become obsessed with estimating his adult weight. I checked his weight religiously and
            made the following toy model. His final adult weight is 29.5-30.0 lbs, so it turns out that a sigmoid function is pretty good
            at capturing puppies' growth (at least with N = 1 :slightly_smiling_face:.)""")
