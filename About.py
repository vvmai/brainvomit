        Whenever I am faced with a (seemingly) big life decision or question, I gravitate
        towards simplifying it into a mathematical model. To me, the joy of doing this is not that it gives exact answers to
        life's problems (nor can it), but that it transforms them into something solvable.
        
        \nIf only every life problem has a closed form solution!
        In my mind, they do. Except when they don't. Then I cry and eat ice cream, like everyone else. :heart:
